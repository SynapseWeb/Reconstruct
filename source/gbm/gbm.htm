<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The GBM package consists of a number of components :-
<UL>
  <LI>A peice of code capable of loading and saving bitmap files
      in a variety of popular
      <A HREF="#formats">file formats</A>.
      Programs may be written to use this code, and thus be able to
      access a variety of file formats without actually knowing
      what format the pictures are in, or any details about file format itself.
  <LI>Some peices of code that perform common operations on bitmap data.
      Such as reflection, X-Y transposition, rotation, cropping, scaling,
      halftoning, error-diffusing, palette mapping, and colour space mapping.
  <LI>Some sample
      <A HREF="#cmdline">command line programs</A>
      which use the above code.

<H2>JPEG support</H2></A>

<P>The Independant JPEG Group have generously allowed others to
use their source code to their JPEG handling library.
The only condition of use is that the IJG must be credited for their work.

<P>Martin Lisowski <CODE>&lt;mlisowsk@aixterm1.urz.uni-heidelberg.de&gt;</CODE>
has generously donated his <CODE>gbmjpg.c</CODE> to GBM.
This file allows GBM to use the IJG 6a library.

<P>GBM may be compiled up either with or without JPEG support.
If you use the JPEG enabled variety of GBM in your project,
you must credit the IJG.

<P>This code has been tested on OS/2, AIX, Linux and Windows.

<!--...sFormats supported:4:-->
<A NAME="formats">
<H2>Formats supported</H2></A>

<P>GBM supports a variety of file formats, such as GIF, TIFF, PCX etc..

<P>Normally, applications using GBM deduce the file format from the file
extension.
eg: <CODE>filename.gif</CODE> is a Compu$erve GIF file.

<P>When specifying file names to programs written using GBM, it is usually
possible to append a comma seperated list of format specific options.
eg: you can say <CODE>webpiccy.gif,ilace</CODE>.
In this case, the <CODE>ilace</CODE> is a cue to the code in GBM which writes
GIF files, to tell it to write an interlaced GIF.

Bitmap : OS/2 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 / Windows 3.0 bitmap : .BMP .VGA .BGA .RLE .DIB .RL4 .RL8
  Reads any of the above if uncompressed or run-length compressed.
  Will not read CCITT G3 MH Fax compressed files.
  Will not read 24 bit RLE files.
  If input is an OS/2 bitmaparray file then which bitmap can be specified.
    Input options: index=# (default: 0)
  Can be made to write OS/2 1.1 or Windows 3.0 / OS/2 2.0 bitmaps
    Output options: 1.1,win,2.0 (default: 2.0, note win=2.0)
  The handling of 1bpp bitmaps is a little complicated.
  When reading 1bpp bitmaps, the palette is ignored.
  1's are considered foreground, and they are considered black.
  0's are considered background, and they are considered white.
  This agrees with WorkPlace Shell WPFolder background mode, and most PM
  programs, but notably disagrees with Windows PBrush.
  When writing 1bpp bitmaps, the actual 2 colours in the palette are
  ignored, and a fixed palette is written. This is so that the resulting
  bitmap will display 1's in black on 0's in white when displayed by
  WPFolder etc..
  Foreground and background colours in palette can be inverted on input.
    Input options: inv
  Foreground and background colours in palette can be inverted on output.
    Output options: inv
  Foreground and background colours in bits can be inverted on input.
    Input options: invb
  Foreground and background colours in bits can be inverted on output.
    Output options: invb
  The best option for writing 1bpp bitmaps is to write the darkest
  colour as the foreground. The resulting bitmap will have darkest
  colour as 1 bits, and lightest colour as 0 bits. When reloaded
  WPFolders and GBM will give a black 1's on white 0's picture.
    Output option: darkfg
  Also, there is an option for writing 1bpp bitmaps with the lightest
  colour as foreground. As WPFolder and GBM assume the foreground is
  black and the background is white on reloading, this will typically
  cause the image to be inverted.
    Output option: lightfg

GIF : CompuServe Graphics Interchange Format : .GIF
  Reads 1, bit data files.
  Reads 2, 3 and 4 bit data files and presents them as 4 bit.
  Reads 5, 6, 7 and 8 bit data files and presents them as 8 bit.
  Writes 1, 4 and 8 bit data files.
  Reads "GIF87a" and "GIF89a" style files.
  Writes "GIF87a" style files.
  Will write "GIF89a" file, if the transcol= option is used.
  Should correctly handle deferred clear-code in LZW data stream.
  Will not generate output with deferred clear-code.
  ie: should not break older GIF readers.
  Can specify index of image within file on read.
    Input option: index=# (default 0)
  Can specify to return decoded data so far rather than error if corrupt.
    Input option: errok
  Can specify screen size to write in output screen descriptor.
    Output options: xscreen=#,yscreen=# (defaults: image size).
  Can specify background colour index to write in file BMHD header.

    Output option: transcol=# (default is none).
  Can specify transparent colour index same as first pixel.
    Output option: transcol=edge
  Can write interlaced GIFs (good for HTML &lt;IMG=SRC="x.gif"&gt;)
    Output option: ilace
  Extensively test on GIF files from a wide variety of sources.
  Compatibility tested with xloadimage and xv.

PCX : ZSoft PC Paintbrush Image format : .PCX .PCC
  Reads and writes 1,4,8 and 24 bit colour files.
  Subset of plane/bits-per-plane combinations supported.
  Files are read and written using a run-length coding scheme.
  Tested using Zsoft originated .PCX files.
  Compressed runs of pixels are not supposed to straddle scan lines.
  GBM never does this, but some other applications violate this rule.
  By default, if GBM finds that a run of pixels is longer than the scan
  line, it will use the leftover pixels on the next scan line.
  Some images will not load properly, as they require the loading
  program to discard those pixels in the run that extend beyond the end
  of the scan line. This behaviour can be enabled in GBM.
    Input option: trunc

<PRE>
TIFF : Microsoft/Aldus Tagged Image File Format support : .TIF .TIFF
  Reads and writes 1,4,8 and 24 bit colour files.
  Can almost read all TIFF 6.0 Baseline compliant files.
    Can read uncompressed and Packbits images.
    CCITT Modified huffman compression is the missing peice.
  Can read some files with extensions to Baseline.
    Can read 1bpp greyscale and palettised files.
    Can read Orientation==4 files.
    Can read PlanarConfiguration==2 files for RGB image data.
    Can read LZW compressed files too.
    Can also read CMYK 4 colour seperation files.
    No JPEG or Y-Cb-Cr support.
  Writes files that comply with TIFF 6.0 Baseline.
    Usually writes uncompressed files only.
    Data is written out as a single large strip.
  Can specify image within TIFF file with many images
    Input option: index=# (default: 0)
  Can write 1bpp as non-Baseline file preserving fg/bg cols
    Output option: pal1bpp
  Can ask for LZW compression.
    Output option: lzw
  Can specify informational tags to append on output.
    Output options: artist=,software=,make=,model=,host=,documentname=,pagename=,imagedescription=

ILBM : Amiga IFF / ILBM Interleaved bitmap format : .IFF .LBM
  Reads 1 bit palettised files.
  Reads 2,3 and 4 bit palettised files, returning them as 4 bit.
  Reads 5,6,7 and 8 bit palettised files, returning them as 8 bit.
  Reads 24 bit images and returns them as 24 bit.
  Reads HAM6, HAM8, SHAM and Extra-Halfbrite images.
  HAM6, HAM8 and SHAM returned as 24 bit data.
  Writes 1,4 and 8 bit palettised colour files.
  Writes 24 bit files normally, or by converting to HAM6 first.
  This loses quality but results are still better than 8 bit.
  Understands the RLE compression scheme used.
  Uses BMHD, CMAP, CAMG and BODY sections of file only.
  Only writes BMHD, CMAP, CAMG and BODY sections in output files.
  Can specify position information in file BHMD header.
    Output options: xpos=#,ypos=# (defaults: 0,0).
  Can specify transparent colour to write in file BMHD header.
    Output option: transcol=# (default: 0)
  Can specify aspect ratio to write in file BMHD header.
    Output options: xaspect=#,yaspect=# (defaults: 1,1).
  Can specify screen size to write in output BMHD header.
    Output options: xscreen=#,yscreen=# (defaults: image size).
  Can specify to write 24 bpp data in HAM6 format.
    Output option: ham6
  Note that when DeluxePaint etc. try to load an 8 bit IFF file, they
  switch to a 32 colour (5 bit mode) and only read the 5 least
  significant planes of the file - this generally looks yukky!
  Tested using DeluxePaint sample bitmaps.

YUV12C : YUV12C M-Motion Frame Buffer : .VID
  Reads files and presents data as 24 bit data.
  Writes 24 bit data files by converting them into 12 bit YUV.

IAX : IBM Image Access eXecutive : .IAX
  Reads array as 8 bit greyscale.
  File format does not hold image dimensions.
  Hence code assumes width is 512 pixels unless overridden.
    Input options: width=# (default: 512)
  File format does not include palette.
  Writes red, green, blue plane or greyscale equivelent of 8 bit image.
    Output options: r,g,b,k (default: k)

<PRE>
Sprite : Archimedes Sprite format from RiscOS : .SPR .SPRITE
  Technically sprite files have no extension.
  But GBM recognises .SPR and .SPRITE for convenience.
  Reads 1,4 and 8 bit sprites.
  'First bit' value in header must be a multiple of 8 (v.likely).
  Will only read image plane, will ignore any mask plane.
  Will handle case when no palette present in file.
  Will default to the default Wimp palette in this case.
  If input contains more than one sprite then which can be specified.
    Input options: index=# (default: 0)
  Will output 1,4 and 8 bit files.
  Will write a palette in the file.
  Will only write an image plane, ie: no mask plane.
  Will write a 16 entry palette for 8 bit data (not 64 entry).
  Will map to wierd archmedes palette when writing 8 bit data.
  Tested reading 4bpp sprites with no palette.
  Tested reading 8bpp sprites with no palette and with 64 entry palette.
  Sprites generated by GBM have been loaded on RiscOS.
  Remember: Use SetType to change type of file from PC-file to Sprite,
  by SetType option of filer menu or "*SetType &lt;filename&gt; Sprite".

<PRE>
PSEG : IBM Printer Page Segment : .PSE .PSEG .PSEG38PP .PSEG3820
  This is a file format used by IBM document/printing systems.
  It is used to represent a bi-level image to be used in a document.
  Reads data and presents a 1bpp bitmap.
  Image is presented 1's as black on 0's as white background.
  PSEG files should be downloaded from a VM host in binary mode.
  Some PSEG files have a corrupt record structure.
  This doesn't cause a problem on VM but can confuse a non-VM reader.
  GBM can be made to attempt to handle these files.
    Input option: fixrec
  Will output 1bpp file.
  Will output file with scale factor of 1000
  Can specify new scale for both x and y
    Output options: scalex=#, scaley=#
  Can double the scale factors (option exists for backwards compatibility).
    Output option: double
  WIll output file with pel values of 2400 (dots per 10 inches, ie: 240 dpi).
  Can specify new pel values for both x and y
    Output options: pelx=#, pely=#
  Palette in 1bpp data is lost when written to file.
  The resulting non-VM file has no record structure.
  So when it is uploaded it must be fixed using FIXL3820 EXEC or similar.
  Image width is rounded up to next multiple of 8 when written.

GemRas : GEM Raster : .IMG
  There is a basic level of support, and assorted XIMG extensions.
  One extension is the inclusion of palette info.
  Another allows 24 bpp data to be placed into an .IMG file.
  Reads 1 bpp files (which are B/W) and returns 1 bpp data.
  Reads 2,3 and 4 bpp files (col, grey, XIMG with pal) and returns 4 bpp.
  Reads 5,6,7 and 8 bpp files (grey, XIMG with pal) and returns 8 bpp.
  Reads 24 bpp (which are by definition XIMG) files and returns 24 bpp.
  Writes 1 bpp data as B/W 1 bpp file.
  Writes 4 bpp data mapped to 'standard' 16 colour palette.
  Or writes 4 bpp data greyscale 4 bpp file.
    Output option: grey
  Or writes 4 bpp data to XIMG file with palette.
    Output option: pal
  There is no 'standard' palette for 256 colour files.
  Writes 8 bpp data as greyscale 8 bpp file.
  Or writes 8 bpp to XIMG file with palette.
    Output option: pal
  Writes 24 bpp data as an XIMG file (normal file can't do 24 bpp).
  The pixel dimensions in microns can be specified.
    Output options: pixw=#,pixh=# (defaults: 85,85)
</PRE>
<PRE>
Portrait : Portrait : .CVP
  In Germany, photographers sometimes supply a floppy with a .CVP on it.
  File holds a single 512x512 24bpp RGB image.
  File is uncompressed, and will therefore always be 3/4Mb.
  You can only write 512x512 images using this format.
  Pixels in the file are not square, the width is approx. 3/4 the height.
  This aspect ratio problem is not adjusted for when reading or writing.
</PRE>
<PRE>
JPEG : JPEG File Interchange Format : .JPG .JPEG .JPE
  Can read 8 bpp (greyscale) and 24 bpp files.
  Can write 24 bpp data to a file.
  Can write with varying degrees of quality.
    Output option: quality=# (range 0 to 100, default 75)
  Can write progressive JPEGs.
    Output option: prog

<P>Note that the GBM module only ever surfaces the size and bits per pixel
of images (regardless of the other information present in the header).
All GBM programs have access to the bitmap file formats documented
above, although this list is omitted in subsequent documentation.

<P>GBMHDR displays output in the following style :-

<P>Listed is the size, bits per pixel, Kb size of the file, a percentage
value, the file format, and the file name.
The percentage is calculated as (filesize*100/datasize) and effectively gives
the compression ratio.
For example <CODE>aab.gif</CODE> is well compressed (to 17% of the theoretical
size).
<CODE>andy.bmp</CODE> gives a &gt;100% value because of the file header.

<P>This program reads the input bitmap.
If it is not 24 bit, then it is	expanded to 24 bit per pixel.
The data is then processed using the supplied mapping giving a 24,8,4 or 1 bit
per pixel image, which is then written to the output bitmap file.

<P>The <CODE>bw</CODE> mapping produces a 1 bpp output file,
<CODE>vga</CODE> and <CODE>4g</CODE> gives 4 bit output files,
<CODE>7x8x4</CODE>, <CODE>6x6x6</CODE>, <CODE>4x4x4</CODE>, <CODE>8g</CODE>,
<CODE>freq</CODE> and <CODE>tripel</CODE> give 8 bit output files.
<CODE>R:G:B</CODE> (where R,G and B are numbers in the range 0 to 8),
gives a 24 bit output file where only the top R bits of red are non-zero,
the top G of green and B of blue.

<P>The normal way to map is simply to map each colour in the source
bitmap to the closest one in the destination bitmap.
However if <CODE>-e</CODE> is supplied, error diffusion is used to get a
smoother result.
Also, if <CODE>-h</CODE> is supplied halftoning may be used instead.
<CODE>-e</CODE> and <CODE>-h</CODE> are not valid together, and are only
valid with certain mappings.

<P>If the bitmap has a palette it maps each palette entry according to the
supplied mapping, otherwise it maps each individual 24 bit pixel.

<P>For example, if you get a 24 bit per pixel image from a Windows video
capture program, the odds are in may be in a gamma corrected colour space

You can convert this to the L* cyclometric colour space used by PM by typing :-
<PRE>
gbmgamma -m p_to_l -g 2.2 captured.bmp nicepm.bmp

<P>The shelf option is primarily for when converting to a gamma corrected
colour space for a specific monitor (when you aren't going to use PM to
display the bitmap, and the display program doesn't do any correction).
Some monitors don't actually start to light up pixels until the pixel

</PRE>

<P>Given a set of bitmaps, it is possible to examine them all and compute
a common palette for holding them, and then generate new bitmaps
mapped to that palette.

<P>The mappings available are frequency based and median-cut based.

<P>Alternatively, it is possible to generate the most suitable palette
for each frame, and then reorder the palettes of each bitmap so as to
be as close as possible to its predecessor.

<P>By reordering palettes (using <CODE>rofreq</CODE>/<CODE>romcut</CODE>)
it is possible to remove almost all flicker on playback.
From frame to frame, almost all palette entries in a given frame, have
close entries in the previous frame.

<P>However for a few, this is not true, and flicker may be seen.
The <CODE>N2</CODE> parameter is designed to alleviate this.
The process will handle the <CODE>N2</CODE> worst palette changes using
<CODE>N2</CODE> extra palette entries.
Thus the <CODE>N2</CODE> worst causes of flicker can be eliminated.
A typical use might be :-
<PRE>
gbmcpal -m romcut240:16 0 100 1 in%02d.bmp out%02d.bmp
</PRE>

<P>This means map each frame to a palette with 240 unique colours in.
Any given frame only uses 240 colours at most.
But the palette is actually 240+16 colours in length, and the additional
16 are used to eliminate flicker caused by the 16 worst matches.

<!--...sColour spaces:4:-->
<A NAME="colspace">
<H2>Colour spaces</H2></A>

<P>If a light is physically twice as bright, the eye does not necessarily see
it as twice as bright.
Also, if a pixel is written onto a monitor screen with twice the value,
the physical intensity of the pixel is not necessarily double.

<P>How exactly should numbers inside a bitmap file relate to physical or
perceived intensitys when displayed on the screen?

<P>In OS/2 PM perceived intensitys are proportional to the values in the bitmap
file.
Pixels in such a bitmap are in the 'L* cyclometric' colour space.

<P>Ray Tracers often write pixel values in the bitmap proportional to the
physical intensity computed for that ray.
Such data is in the 'intensity' colour space.

<P>Finally, if a bitmap holds values computed in such a way as to
compensate for the gamma of the monitor (ie: intensitys transformed to
cancel out the gamma of the monitor), then the data is in
a 'gamma corrected' colour space.

<P>So, if you have some Ray Tracer output, and you wish to display on an 8514
monitor WITHOUT using OS/2 PM, then to get a decent colour rendition, you must
map the bitmap from the 'intensity' to a 'gamma corrected' colour space.
To do this you must know the gamma of the 8514 monitor (which is about 2.1).

<P>Also, if you have some Ray Tracer output, and you wish to display on
OS/2 PM, then to get a decent rendition you must map the bitmap from
the 'intensity' to the 'L* cyclometric' colour space.

<P><A HREF="#gbmgamma">GBMGAMMA</A> is a colour mapping program capable
of performing mappings between any 2 of the 3 colour spaces above.

<P>Mapping of this sort should really be done on 24 bit data, before
error-diffusion or halftoning takes place.

<!--...sMaking bitmap animations:4:-->
<A NAME="anim">
<H2>Making bitmap animations</H2>

<P>GBM was originally written as the bitmap handling portion of my homebrew
Ray Tracer, RT.
RT was originally written to allow me to trace snazzy animations.
For example, here is what I did to make a spinning globe animation.

<P>First I traced a largish number of individual bitmap frames using RT.
I wrote these out under the names <CODE>globeNNN.tif</CODE> where
<CODE>NNN</CODE> is <CODE>000</CODE>, <CODE>010</CODE>, <CODE>020</CODE>,
... <CODE>350</CODE> (ie: the angle of rotation in degrees).
I used the <CODE>,lzw</CODE> option to get the files
written LZW encoded to reduce the disk space requirements.

<P>Then to map the data to a common palette, I used
<A HREF="#gbmcpal">GBMCPAL</A> :-
<PRE>
gbmcpal -m freq6:6:6:256 0 360 10 globe%03d.tif globe%03d.bmp

<P>Obviously there are file formats specifically for holding animations, and
algorithms for having animations where palette entries vary from frame to
frame, but the simple example above is ok for many purposes.

<P>GBM was originally written as the file handling part of my homebrew
ray tracer, RT.

<P>My follow-on Modular Renderer package, MR, uses GBM.
It does wire-frame, polygon rendering and raytracing.

<P>Martin Lisowski informed me he was working on something he calls GBMV3,
which is like the OS/2 PM GBMV2 viewer, only with extra features.

<P>From time to time I notice people (other than myself) using GBM either
in its precompiled DLL form, or by recompiling bits of the source.
Sometimes people email me to let me know.

<P>Of course, simply using the code unmodified makes it easier for you
to pick up improvements in the code, as and when they happen.

<P>IBM WebExplorer used the Bitmap, GIF and XBM handling parts of GBM to
some degree - in <CODE>webexwin.dll</CODE>, around byte offset 86924 (in my
copy) are a whole load of GBM error strings.

<P>IBM VisualAge C++ 3.0 for OS/2 used large wedges of GBM source code.
I think they used it in their supplied <CODE>class IGBitmap</CODE>.
This is apparent from the object filenames listed in
<CODE>\ibmcpp\iocdll\cppoou3.rsp</CODE>
and the exported function names in
<CODE>\ibmcpp\iocdll\cppoou3.def</CODE>.

<P>The IBM Person to Person personal conferencing system for OS/2 used the
PCX and TIFF parts of GBM, and I think the AIX variant used whole loads more.

<P>BITMAP32, a bitmap viewer for OS/2 PM, uses GBM.DLL unmodified.
Because the IBM Developer Connection shipped BITMAP32, they ship GBM too.

<P>BluePaint, an OS/2 PM painting program, being developed for
Shareware (I think) uses GBM.DLL unmodified.

Win32 using Visual C++ (version 4.0, 4.2, 5.0, 6.0) or
Visual Studio (2005, 2008, 2013),
32 bit DOS using Watcom C/C++ version (10.6 and 11.0b) + CauseWay 1.3,
AIX using xlc,
and Linux and MacOSX using various versions of gcc.
I've also compiled on mingw-w64.

<P>It should port to any modern 32 bit platform easily enough.
Recently, a lot of work has gone into making it compile and work
on 64 bit Linux (x86_64), and this may benefit other 64 bit platforms.

<P>As a result of the 64 bit cleanup, certain <CODE>typedef</CODE>s and
<CODE>#define</CODE>s were removed from the source code.
Their replacements are designed to work better regardless of platform
bit size, and to be less likely to collide with definitions made by
other software modules.
Code will need updating to use the new types (very easy to do), or
alternatively, <CODE>#define OLD_GBM_TYPES</CODE> can be used
to bring back the old types.

<H2>Platform specific customisation</H2>

<P>When you unzip the source package, you get a directory full of

So your first step before building should be to copy the appropriate
subdirectory into the main directory.
eg: when building OS2
<PRE>

<P>The platform dependant files are basically just <CODE>makefile</CODE>s,

<P>The UNIX <CODE>makefile</CODE> supports a variety of different UNIXes.
By default it supports Linux, but can be made to work on other UNIXes

<!--...sJPEG support:4:-->
<H2>JPEG support</H2>

<P>To build with JPEG support, you need the Independant JPEG Groups library
version 6a installed in a directory somewhere.
For convenience, a copy is included in the jpeg-6a subdirectory.

<P>You then edit/check that the makefile you are using references this
directory correctly.
There is a make variable called <CODE>IJG</CODE> which must point to the
correct directory.
On UNIX, use of this directory is indicated by passing <CODE>JPEG=1</CODE>
to make.
On PCs, you uncomment the <CODE>IJG</CODE> definition to make it active.

<P>When building with JPEG support, the build process works by copying
a shrunk down <CODE>makefile</CODE> called <CODE>makeijgo</CODE> to
wherever the IJG 6a is installed, and also a configuration file.
It then builds the library using compiler switches suitable for
building objects which are to be a part of the main GBM library.

<H3>Compu$erve GIF Tax</H3>

<P>Both Unisys and IBM (and others) have various patents pertaining to the LZW
algorithm used in GIF and LZW compressed TIFF files.

<P>For many years Unisys have only licensed their LZW technology in hardware
implementations (typically Modems).
Now Unisys (through Compu$erve) are looking to license the use of LZW
in software applications, such as GIF and TIFF.
This is the infamous 'Compu$erve GIF Tax'.

<P>Unisys have stated (in news postings) that non-commercial
software need not be licensed.

<P>So GBM continues to support GIF and LZW compressed TIFF.

<P>On 20th June 2003, US Patent 4,558,302 expired.
This is the patent that describes the use of LZW in GIF files.
Therefore, authors of commercial programs should no longer need to pay
Compu$erve / UNISYS to use GIF.

<P>This patent is probably part of the reason the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</A>

Perhaps one day I'll add support for this,
although if I do, this will create a dependency on the
